For my spring based project, i needed to upgrade the spring version from 3.1.2.RELEASE to the latest ie 5.1.4. 
This document captures the hurdles faced and solutions for the issue.
Updating the Spring to latest version made the code not to compile. I needed to add additional depedencies namely spring-tx, spring-jdbc and 
spring-context-support as depedency for spring-context.
Since we are using spring-security in our project, i was forced to update the springframework.security to latest ie 5.1.3 release.

web.xml needs updatation of xmlns and xsi:schemalocation  to the latest. This updation is required to be on the latest. It did not throw
any error per se.

In the servelet context xml, you need to refer to latest schema definitions for the spring framework. You need to do the same in all such xml 
configuration files.
Main changes are wrt security context.in the http section you need to include use-expressions="false" so that  access parameter
defined like (access="ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN") remains same OR you need to change this  to (access="hasanyrole('ROLE_USER', 'ROLE_ADMIN')").
This ensures backword compatibility.
Example <intercept-url pattern="/repositories/*/profiles" access="hasAnyRole('ROLE_USER', 'ROLE_ADMIN')" method="GET"/>

Spring security configuration needs the login form point to j_security_check servelet and user credentials are collected in j_username and j_password.
Spring 4 onwords security filters are enabled by default. So csrf protection filter prevents this call forwarding saying http 405, POST is not supported
for j_spring_security_check. You need to put <csrf disabled="true"> in http section on security context xml.
For correct user credential mapping, In the login form, the params name getting user credentials need to be changed to username and password from j_username and j_password 
OR add username-parameter="j_username" password-parameter="j_password"in security-context.xml's form-login section.
Also login-processing-url="/j_spring_security_check" needs to be added to security-context.xml's form-login section.
